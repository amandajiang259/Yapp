# Yapp - Social Wellness Web App

Yapp is built with Next.js and TypeScript on the client side, styled using Tailwind CSS. Firebase handles user authentication and serves as the main database. Most of the project is organized in the Yapp folder, and environment variables are securely stored outside version control.

Yapp is a full-stack social media web application designed to foster a safe, uplifting environment for self-reflection and meaningful connection. Unlike traditional platforms that promote endless scrolling, Yapp prioritizes mental wellness by encouraging users to share daily affirmations, respond to thoughtful weekly prompts, and connect based on shared interests.

Users can post personal stories, reflect on their experiences, and engage with content aligned with their values. With features like customizable profiles, post discovery, and real-time messaging, Yapp offers a fun, relaxing, and reflective space where users can build genuine relationships and inspire one another.
